## Funcraft Freecube (WIP)

As an old player of the freecube of Funcraft _(largest French minecraft server since its closure in August 2023)_.<br>
I decided to recreate it identically in Minecraft 1.20.2. <br>
This is an improved version of the original freecube, with more features. <br>
The freecube itself has already been 100% recreated, but some details like ranks and the friend system are still missing.
I'm working on it !

## TODO

- [x] Data storage system
- [x] Request lifecycle management
- [x] Fix the permissions on the entity generator and the pvp areas
- [x] Fix the chat system (broadcast)
- [x] Manage pvp zones, and decide whether to be active only with blunt or ranged weapons
- [ ] Fix the music transmitter (and maybe the entity generator and pvp areas, could not create more than one line in inventory)
- [ ] Fix the double message when player get teleported to the spawn of plot (preference called twice or more)
- [ ] Friend system
- [ ] Rank system
- [ ] Report system
- [ ] Fast editing system (SpeedEdit, Voxelsniper, etc...)
- [ ] Setname on the plot

## Original Features

- [x] All the new blocks of the 1.20
- [x] Ability to add music transmitters to the plot
- [x] Ability to add zones generating passive mobs
- [x] Custom weathers (rain, snow, thunder)
