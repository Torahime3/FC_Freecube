## Funcraft Freecube (WIP)

As an old player of the freecube of Funcraft _(largest French minecraft server since its closure in August 2023)_.<br>
I decided to recreate it identically in Minecraft 1.20.4 <br>
This is an improved version of the original freecube, with more features. <br>
The freecube itself has already been 100% recreated, but some details like ranks and the friend system are still missing.
I'm working on it !
